# A* Search Algorithm Visualizer

This project provides a visual representation of the A* search algorithm at work within a Pygame window. Designed to demonstrate the algorithm's pathfinding capabilities, this Python application is a valuable learning tool for students and enthusiasts interested in AI and algorithms.

## Features

- Visualization of the A* algorithm's pathfinding process.
- Interactive grid to set start, end, and obstacle nodes.
- Real-time display of the algorithm's search pattern.

## Demo

A video demo is available to show the visualizer in action:
